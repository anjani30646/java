Bob Challenges Alex to code with the following problem: Find the total number of sequences of length n 
(using H and T) such that no two Hs are next to each other. For example, for n = 2, 
we have 3 possible sequences: HT TH TT

Input Format
The only line of input is the value of n

Constraints
2<=n<=20

Output Format
Print the total number of sequences possible with no 2 H's consecutive
